# Variable Definitions 
- In C++ all variable must be defined (by a type) before they can be used because the variable definition is what causes the variables to be created in memory.
- `double`:
  - variables that hold double recision floating-point numbers 
  - E.g.: 
    - `double hours, rate, pay;` 
      - whre hours, rate, and pay are variables 

# Input, Processing, and Output
-  these are the 3 primary activities of a program

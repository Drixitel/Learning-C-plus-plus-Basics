# Gladdis: CH1 - test change
# Computer 
- CPU
  - Program
- Main Memory (RAM)
- Seconday storage devices 
- Input devices 
  - info taken from outward devices
  - mouse, microphone, etc. 
- Output Devices 
  - any info sent out by the computer
  - CDs, screens, speakers, etc.


# The CPU 
>(Central Processing Unit)
- Processes Programs in Machine Language 
- Most important component 
- preforming a task = running/executing the program
- Is the part of the computer that runs the progam
- Current CPUs: 
  - Microprocessors (palm size)
  - Fetch, follow instruction, produce result
- Within CPUs:
  - <ins>Control Unit </ins>
    - Coordinates all the operations
    - determines where to get the next instruction and regulating the other major component that control signal 
  - <ins>Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)</ins>
    - preforms math operations 


## Program: 
- set of instructions that tells the computer how to preform/solve a task
- The set of instructions = `Algorithm` 
  - Has steps and are hierarchical
- stored in memory 
- fetch/decode/execute cycle
- Fetch
  - from main memory the next instruction 
- Decode
  - number code instruction, control unit decodes and generates and signal 
- Execute 
  - signal is routed to the respective computer component 
  - signal causes an operation 

## `Machine Language` 
- consists of a sequence of binary numbers (1,0) which is interpreted as commads 
- Each CPU has its own machine language 

# Main Memory aka (RAM)
- RAM: Random-Access Memory 
- the work area 
- stores a program here hile the progam is running as well as the data used for that progam 
  - E.g: <br>
  Word doc to write an essay<br>
  Both the program and the essay are stored 
- RAM: 
  - able to quickly access data stored at any random loaction in memory 
  - is a volatile type of memory 
  - used for temporary storage while a program runs
  - Turn off computer: 
    - DELETES RAM CONTENTS 
   - Stored in small chips 
- Seconday Storage 
  - takes up the memory from RAM even if the computer is turned off
  - Disk Drive
    - encodes memory onto the disk
- Memory Storage
  - divided into tiny storage cells (BYTES)
- BYTES
  - Each byte is assinged a number "address" ordered from lowest to highest 
  - 1 byte: can store a single letter of the alphabet OR a small number
  - Current computers story millions, billions 
- BITS (Binary Digit)
  - 8 smaller storage locations for Bytes
  - "Tiny switches" that can be either on or off
  - electrical components that can hold a positive or negative change 
    - POSITIVE = ON 
    - NEGATIVE = OFF 

# Software
- System software 
- Application software 
## System Software 
- control and manage basic operations 
- Operating Systems (OS)
  - controls the internal operations of the computer's hardware
  - manages all devices connected 
  - allows data to be saved and retrieved from storage devices 
  - allows other programs to run 
- Utility Programs 
  - performs specialized task that enhances the computers operation or safegaurds data 
  - E.g.: 
    - Virus scanners, file-compression,  data-backup
- Software Development Tools
  - used to create/modify/test software
  - E.g.: 
    - Compilers
    - integrated development enviorments 

## Aplication Software
- Every day tasks 
- E.g.: 
  - Word, Powerpoint, etc. 

# Source Code, Object Code, and Exectuable Code 
- A source file has source code
  - `Helloworld.cpp` is a source file 
  - The `code` inside this file is the source code. 
  - More of this see file: `README.md`
  ### Preprocessor < Compiler < Linker < Execute file
- IDEs: Integrated Development environments 
  - These do all the steps mentioned previously at a one click, my program ad-ons have these features.
